#Meal
An easy way to create templated components on the fly. Meal takes templated files (whether from the npm module directory or your project directory), replaces occurences of "COMPONENT" with what you specify in your command `$ meal make __cool__ card` (in this case cool), and outputs the files in your resources directory or wherever you specify within the __meal.js__.

##Installation

first install it globally

`$ npm install meal -g`

Then call it

`$ meal`

##Example
Basically 

##Usage

meal list

meal make
